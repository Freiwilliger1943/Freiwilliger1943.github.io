It should go without saying that most of these private developments took heavy influence from W.C. Geer's concepts. One of which was a last-ditch attempt to make use of the American-Tissot platform to develop a compact, self-contained mask for the U.S. Navy. This being the Goodrich-Tissot Navy Head Canister Mask, which was developed between February and March of 1918, being finalized on April 11th of the same year (well before the Whittlesey, Ravenna, and Miller Tissot Masks).
<br>
It should also be noted that after this point, due to the proliferation of Tissot concepts among various private companies, the designation 'American-Tissot' became only applicable to Goodrich/BoM designs predating April of 1918, seeing as they were the only collaborating industries making an effort to domesticate the French Tissot design. From April of 1918 onwards, the American Tissot, Model of 1918, Bureau of Mines Type became referred to as the Bureau of Mines Tissot, and all subsequent Tissot mask designs would be named after their fostering designer(s), companies, and/or regions of manufacture. To lessen the chance of confusion, I will continue to refer to the American-Tissot series as such.
<br>
The Goodrich-Tissot was Geer's first entry and a trend-setter into this period of attempting to think outside the parameters of the conventional American-Tissot design - even the Miller-Tissot, which Geer had likely been contracted for production assistance on after, was heavily influenced by this mask. As mentioned before, it was primarily aimed at a Navy contract, submitted alongside the American-Tissot, Navy Shoulder Type Mask, which was delegated to the role of a special purpose mask. Overall, the Goodrich-Tissot Navy Head Canister made much use of the final pattern BoM American-Tissot, but with several obvious changes.
<br>
The facepiece now in corporated an external, curved airflow deflector channel, similar to the subsequent Miller-Tissot, running over the top of the left lens and towards the back of the head. Also like the Miller-Tissot, the Goodrich-Tissot did away with the Y-shaped clarifying tubes and used a simple bridge of rubber over the inlet between the eyepieces. The outet valve was a crude modification to the BoM American-Tissot angletube in which the hose stem and clarifying tube port were blanked off entirely, leaving only the flutter valve and guard bracket assembly.
<br>
The head harness was a unique and revolutionary concept for the time, this being a mesh stockinette material in the form of a skull-cap which covered and cradled the entire head, being attached to the facepiece at all the normal attachment points. A padded cushion and leather pouch supported a cut-down box-type canister on the back of the head, eliminating the need for a corrugated hose or carrier of any sort. This canister reportedly had one-half the life of the standard Type 'H' canister, and weighed a total of 16.5 ounces.
<br>
The leather pouch the canister was contained in had a stud and flap closure assembly, and the breathing tube of the mask furnished with a French Tissot-style hose latch, so that the canister could be removed from the mask and harness for ease of replacement or inspection. The canister was noted on it's light weight and the facepiece for its general comfort and good seal, however the significantly short life span of the filter and its poor protection for smoke lead the Navy to rejecting it and ending the contract around May of 1918 in favor of another mask which placed a larger canister on top of the head. </p>
